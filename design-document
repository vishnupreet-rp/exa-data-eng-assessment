Problem
    Patient data is spread across multiple semi structured files which makes analysis hard

Task
    Re-format the files into a readable format to perform analysis

Solution
    Using PySpark job format the files, generate extracts and upload to S3

Tech Stack
    -> PySpark
    -> S3
    ->Athena

High Level Design
    Input json files -> PySpark job (Transformation) -> Upload files to S3 -> Query data using Athena


How to run
    Requirements.txt file is included in the repo where all the required libraries are listed with version
    Place all the json files to be processed under data directory
    Configure aws access and secret keys to establish connection (if not, job will fail during S3 upload)
    Trigger the job (src/main.py)
    In aws console, open athena service and start analysing the data
